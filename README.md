# 🍽️ FoodDiv — MERN Stack Food Ordering App

**FoodDiv** is a full-stack food ordering web application built as part of my journey to learn and apply the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack in real-world scenarios.

> 📌 *This project helped me learn backend integration, REST APIs, JWT authentication, and state management in React.*
